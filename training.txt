patterns begin to appear on the surface of objects.  When these effects first start to come on, I usually find myself thinking that the "mystic lizards" are here, given that the patterns the visuals create are very similar to M. C. Escher artwork of entwined lizards or other repeating patterns.

When I lay on my bed, I saw myself as an old, old man, many years in the future.  I was appalled to see my forearm as a withered, dry-skinned, almost-bone which could only be that of someone dying.  I looked down at the rest of me, and I was thin, emaciated, brittle, shallow.

Subject on the street in Greenwich Village, NYC: People continued to stream towards us and past us.  I focused on an old lady in her late seventies, a dowdy pathetic creature dressed in shabby black and carrying impossibly huge shopping bags.  As she made her way heavily towards us I saw, no longer much to my astonishment, that she began to lose years.  I saw her as an Italian matriarch in her sixties, then in her fifties.  As she continued to bloom backwards in time, she entered her portly forties and, after that, her housewifely thirties.  Her face softened, her body grew more shapely, and still the years kept on dropping away.  In her twenties she was carrying a child, and then she was a bride and carried orange blossoms.  A moment later and she was a child who, in turn, shrank into a newborn baby carried by a midwife.  The baby's umbilical cord was still intact and it let out a howl of awakening life.  But then the process was reversed and the baby grew back into childhood, became again a bride, passed through her thirties, forties, fifties, sixties, and was the old lady in her seventies I had seen at the beginning.  The old woman blinked, her eyes closed for a fraction of a second, and in that instant I clearly saw her death mask.  She passed us by and had moved a little down the street when I heard from the direction she had come a baby's howl of awakening life.  I turned my head, expecting to perceive afresh Our Lady of the Eternal Return, but saw instead the vortex of a crowd.

S is told to look at the flowered fabric of the couch on which he is sitting and to relate what he sees there.  He perceives a great number of faces and scenes, each of them belonging to a different environment and to a variety of times: some to the American Gay Nineties, some to the nineteen twenties, some later.  There are Tolouse Lautrec cafâ€š figures, Berlin nightlife scenes and German art from the late twenties and mid thirties.  Here and there, a "Black Art" appears and he recognizes the work of Felicien Rops and drawings like those of the artist who has illustrated Michelet's Satanism and Witchcraft.  There are various Modigliani figures, a woman carrying a harpoon, and persons such as appear in the classical Spanish art of the seventeenth century.  Most interesting to him are "paintings" like those of Hieronymus Bosch, and he describes a great complex of sprawling yet minutely detailed figures which combine to make up a larger complex of a mountain scene of trees and snow.  In another variation, this same complex consists of "a great face with the trunk of an elephant that is blowing liquid on the face of a demon whose body has been trampled into the ground.  The elephant is blowing liquid on the face of the demon either in an attempt to revive him or as a gesture of contempt.  A Herculean male figure rises next to the elephantine face.  He is trapped to the waist in stone and this marbled stone looks like sea foam, it is so delicate and lacy.  Everything blends into everything else.  The Herculean figure is also the ear of a face and the elephant-like trunk is the bridge of the nose of another larger, still more complicated figure.

I lay on my back and looked up at the ceiling where a kaleidoscope of images from ancient civilizations flickered rapidly before my eyes.  Egypt and Greece, Assyria and old China sped across the ceiling.  Flickering pharaohs, fluttering parthenons and palpitating Nebuchadnezzar - all contributed to this panoramic, historical agitation.  (example of seeing objects or scenes that are not there, in this case projected on a blank surface)

Subject is a four year old boy who accidentally took the drug: S continued intermittently to see crabs and lobsters coming out of the walls and crawling across the floor towards him...S also hallucinated a whole array of "monsters" - apparently creatures such as elves, dwarfs, and other small, deformed human-like beings.  Fearful at first, he gained confidence when his mother encouraged him to "make friends with the monsters" ...  After some of his anxieties were disposed of, several of the "monsters" came and sat on S's knees and in the palm of his hand and he talked with them.  Others danced around him and made faces.

a space station below me, and to my right. Presences were guiding me to a platform. I was also aware of many entities inside the space station-automatons, androidlike creatures that looked like a cross between crash-test dummies and Empire troops for Star Wars, except that they were living beings, not robots. They had checkerboard patterns on parts of their bodies, especially their upper arms. They were doing some kind of routine technological work, and paid little attention to me.

I saw a world that presented itself in several guises.  It had a marvel of color that was, for me, without precedent, for I had never particularly noticed the world of color.  The rainbow had always provided me with all the hues I could respond to.  Here, suddenly, I had hundreds of nuances of color which were new to me, and which I have never, even today, forgotten.

He could never, poor fellow, have seen a bunch of flowers shining with their own inner light and all but quivering under the pressure of the significance with which they were charged; could never have perceived that what rose and iris and carnation so intensely signified was nothing more, and nothing less, than what they were - a transience that was yet eternal life, a perpetual perishing that was at the same time pure Being, a bundle of minute, unique particulars in which, by some unspeakable and yet self-evident paradox, was to be seen the divine source of all existence...  I saw the books, but was not at all concerned with their positions in space.  What I noticed, what impressed itself upon my mind was the fact that all of them glowed with living light and that in some the glory was more manifest than in others.

For me as a person, rather than simply a student of psychology, the most important thing about that first experience was that for the first time in my life I knew what the word "beauty" meant.  True, I had spoken of it thousands of times before, had pointed at objects I'd been taught to believe were beautiful and said the word in association with them, and had occasionally had vague, moderately positive feelings in connection with such objects.  Now I understand that I had never even begun to penetrate what beauty was all about.  While the incredible and intense immediate experience of beauty faded rapidly after the experiment, a door had been opened in my mind and senses that would never close completely.

This turned out to be a day of extraordinary visuals and interpretations. About two hours into it, I felt that the effects were still climbing, but there was a marvelous onset of visual distortions and illusions, right at the edge of hallucination. The logs in the fireplace were in continuous motion. The notepaper I was writing on seemed to scrunch and deform under the pressure of the pen. Nothing would stay still; everything was always moving.

I have a picture in my living room that is a stylized German scene with a man on horseback riding through the woods, and a young girl coming out to meet him from the nearby trees. But she was not just 'coming out.'  He was not just riding through the woods.  The wind was blowing, and his horse was at full gallop, and his cape was flapping in the storm, and she was bearing down upon him at full bore.  The action never ceased.  I became exhausted.

I also feel the space is different. It might be because I have a different sensitivity with the light and shade.  The hall felt narrower.  The diagonal distance between me standing beside the microwave oven to the far corner of the dinning room is longer than usual.  When I look at the wall, the wall is actually not totally even, if I looked at it long enough, it began to float, some images would come out, and they are moving.  I glanced at a magazine, the characters were higher than the page, they are 3-dimensional with their shade.

I experienced feelings of basic identity and oneness with the universe; it was the Tao, the Beyond that is Within, the Tat tvam asi (Thou art That) of the Upanishads.  I lost my sense of individuality; my ego dissolved, and I became all of existence.  Sometimes this experience was intangible and contentless, sometimes it was accompanied by many beautiful visions - archetypal images of Paradise, the ultimate cornucopia, golden age, or virginal nature.  I became fish swilling in crystal-clear waters, butterflies floating in mountain meadows, and seagulls gliding by the ocean.  I was the ocean, animals, plants, the clouds - sometimes all these at the same time.

the best way that I can describe it would be this ultimate expansion.  And in its expansion, there was the dissolution of any sense of past, or future, and these concepts of past and future just dissolved away, into what can only be described as the eternal present, the absolute being of this moment, without any past and without any future.  And within that there was also the complete dissolution of any sense of personal ego, or identity, or sense of self, so that there was only the awareness of this pure present moment.  There was no self there, it was just the awareness of the moment itself.  And that moment, that absolute moment, without any past and without any future, really I can only describe, as, pure consciousness, pure being, pure love, and absolute acceptance of all things.

In all my previous sessions, I had always maintained basic orientation. I knew who I was, where I was, and why I was having unusual experiences. This time all this dissolved in a matter of seconds. The awareness of my everyday existence, my name, my whereabouts, and my life disappeared as if by magic. Stan Grof ... California ... United States ... planet Earth ... These concepts faintly echoed for a few moments like dreamlike images on the far periphery of my consciousness and then faded away altogether. I tried hard to remind myself of the existence of the realities I used to know, but they suddenly did not make any sense. In all my previous psychedelic sessions there always had been some rich specific content. The experiences were related to my present lifetime-the story of my childhood, infancy, birth, and embryonal life-or to various themes from the transpersonal domain-my past life experiences, images from human history, archetypal visions of deities and demons, or visits to various mythological domains. This time, none of these dimensions even seemed to exist, let alone manifest. My only reality was a mass of radiant swirling energy of immense proportions that seemed to contain all Existence in a condensed and entirely abstract form. I became Consciousness facing the Absolute.
